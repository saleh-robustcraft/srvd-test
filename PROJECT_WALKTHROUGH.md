# Project Walkthrough: Delivery Admin Dashboard & Routing Logic

## Overview
This project is a full-stack delivery management and route optimization system for dispensary orders. It features a modern admin dashboard, simulated route batching, and a modular codebase for easy extension. The stack includes:
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

---

## Backend Walkthrough (`backend/`)

### 1. Entry Point & Server Setup
- **`src/app.ts`**: Initializes the Express app, applies middleware (JSON parsing, CORS), and mounts routes from `src/routes/orderRoutes.ts`.
- **`src/server.ts`**: Connects to MongoDB using `src/config/db.ts` and starts the Express server. Reads environment variables from `.env`.

### 2. Database Model
- **`src/models/Order.ts`**: Defines the Mongoose schema for an order:
  - `customer`: String (customer name/info)
  - `dispensary`: String (dispensary name/info)
  - `borough`: String (e.g., Brooklyn, Queens)
  - `status`: Enum (`PLACED`, `DISPATCHED`, etc.)
  - `createdAt`: Date (auto-generated)

### 3. Controllers (Business Logic)
- **`src/controllers/orderController.ts`**:
  - `getOrders(req, res)`: Fetches all orders, optionally filtered by borough (via `?borough=...`). Returns orders sorted by `createdAt` (newest first).
  - `updateOrderStatus(req, res)`: Updates the status of an order by ID. Returns the updated order or 404 if not found.
  - `createOrder(req, res)`: Creates a new order with provided customer, dispensary, and borough. Sets status to `PLACED` by default.
  - `optimizeRoutes(req, res)`: Simulates route optimization:
    - Fetches all `PLACED` orders
    - Groups orders by `borough`
    - For each borough with 5+ orders, creates a batch and assigns a fleet (e.g., "Fleet A", "Fleet B", ...)
    - Returns: array of batches (with borough, count, assignment, order IDs) and count of unbatched orders

### 4. Routes
- **`src/routes/orderRoutes.ts`**: Express router mapping endpoints to controller functions:
  - `GET /orders`: List all orders (optionally filter by borough)
  - `POST /orders`: Create a new order
  - `PATCH /orders/:id/status`: Update order status
  - `GET /orders/optimize`: Get optimized route batches

### 5. Utilities & Config
- **`src/utils/asyncHandler.ts`**: Wraps async route handlers to catch errors and pass them to Express error middleware.
- **`src/config/db.ts`**: Handles MongoDB connection using Mongoose.

### 6. Environment & Scripts
- **`.env`**: Set `MONGODB_URI` and other secrets.
- **Scripts**:
  - `npm run dev`: Start backend in development mode (nodemon)
  - `npm start`: Start backend in production

---

## Frontend Walkthrough (`frontend/`)

### 1. API Layer
- **`api/api.ts`**: Centralized Axios client for backend API. Exports:
  - `getOrders(borough?)`: Fetches all or borough-filtered orders
  - `updateOrderStatus(id, status)`: Updates order status
  - `optimizeRoutes()`: Fetches optimized batches from backend

### 2. TypeScript Types
- **`types/index.ts`**: Defines types/interfaces for `Order`, `OrderStatus`, `Borough`, `Batch`, etc. Used throughout the app for type safety.

### 3. App Pages (Next.js App Router)
- **`app/admin/page.tsx`**: Redirect to `/admin/dashboard`).
- **`app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`**: Main dashboard UI:
  - Fetches and displays all open orders (status `PLACED`)
  - Integrates filter, table, and batch optimization components
  - Handles loading and empty states
- **`app/admin/orders-grouped/page.tsx`**: (Optional) Displays orders grouped by borough

### 4. Components
- **Order Table & Display:**
  - `OrderTable.tsx`: Renders a table of orders, each row includes:
    - Customer
    - Dispensary
    - Status
    - Borough
    - Actions (status update)
  - `OrderRow.tsx`: Renders a single order row with actions (status update)
  - `OrderTableHeader.tsx`: Table headers
  - `EmptyState.tsx`, `TableSkeleton.tsx`: UI for loading/empty states
- **Filters & Grouping:**
  - `BoroughFilter.tsx`: Dropdown or buttons for borough selection; updates displayed orders
  - `OrdersByBoroughDisplay.tsx`: Groups and displays orders by borough
- **Batching & Optimization:**
  - `OptimizeButton.tsx`: Button to trigger route optimization (calls `optimizeRoutes`)
  - `OptimizedBatches.tsx`: Displays optimized batches (borough, fleet assignment, order count, order IDs)
- **Layout/UI:**
  - `NavbarHeader.tsx`: Top navigation bar
  - `MuiProvider.tsx`: Material UI provider (if using MUI)

### 5. Context & State Management
- **`context/OrderContext.tsx`**: React context for global order state. Provides functions to fetch, update, and manage orders across components.

### 6. Utilities
- **`utils/groupByBorough.ts`**: Groups orders by borough for display or logic
- **`utils/ui.tsx`**: UI utility functions/components

### 7. Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
  - `globals.css`, `tailwind.config.js`, etc.

### 8. Environment & Scripts
- **`.env.local`**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to backend base URL
- **Scripts**:
  - `npm run dev`: Start frontend in development mode
  - `npm run build && npm start`: Build and start in production

## Feature Walkthrough (End-to-End)

### 1. Viewing All Open Delivery Orders (Admin Dashboard MVP)
- On `/admin/dashboard`, the app fetches all orders with status `PLACED` using `getOrders()`.
- Orders are displayed in a table with columns:
  - Customer
  - Dispensary
  - Status
  - Borough
  - Actions (status update)
- Loading and empty states are handled with `TableSkeleton.tsx` and `EmptyState.tsx`.

### 2. Filtering by Borough
- `BoroughFilter.tsx` provides a UI to select a borough.
- When a borough is selected, the dashboard fetches and displays only orders from that borough.
- Filtering is handled via API (`getOrders(borough)`) and/or frontend grouping (`groupByBorough.ts`).

### 3. Updating Order Status (PLACED → DISPATCHED)
- Each order row includes an action (button or dropdown) to update status (e.g., `PLACED` → `DISPATCHED`).
- On action, `updateOrderStatus(id, status)` is called, updating the backend and refreshing the UI.
- State is managed via context (`OrderContext.tsx`) or local state.

### 4. Routing Logic: Simulated Grouping and Batch Output
- Admin clicks the optimize button (`OptimizeButton.tsx`).
- Calls `optimizeRoutes()` API, which triggers backend logic to group orders by borough and create batches (if 5+ orders in a borough).
- Backend responds with an array of batches (each with borough, order count, assigned fleet, and order IDs) and the count of unbatched orders.
- `OptimizedBatches.tsx` displays each batch, including:
  - Borough name
  - Number of orders in batch
  - Assigned fleet (e.g., "Fleet A")
  - List of order IDs (or order details)
- UI also shows the number of unbatched orders (if any remain).
